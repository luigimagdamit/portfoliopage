  * **Repository:**  https://github.com/luigimagdamit/zoomphonebook
  * **Description:**  This program consists of a multi-role, ticket creation login page, dashboard for users, dashboard for administrators, report page for a database that holds ticket information such as auto-generated ticket ID, requester names, assigned groups, dates, phone numbers and email address. This allows ticket searches and updates or deletes. There are profiles created through the login screen that is added to the database as well. Roles are assigned by the administrators and levels of security are established by those levels given. There are two versions, one with a database creation using Microsoft SQL server and the other with Sqlite to be more compact and deployable.  The Sqlite version was all created line by line and automatically recreates itself if deleted.

  * **Repository:**  https://github.com/luigimagdamit/AthenaeumMobileApp
  * **Description:**  This is a program I designed in C# to show methods and class creations. I created 3 pigs, 3 horses, 3 cows, and 3 chickens. Each has their own function of speak, eat, produce, and move. I got a little carried away with this project and wanted to maximize the screen and center the WriteLineâ€™s, add some sounds, bring a little color and some ACSII text into the mix. I had a lot of fun building this, please enjoy!
  * **Tools:**  React Native, JavaScript, Google Firebase

  * **Repository:**  https://github.com/Silcott/PORTFOLIO-OF-PROJECTS/tree/master/PROJECTS/WaterDashBoard
  * **Description:**  This is an overkill excel spreadsheet with all the bells and whistles.  I used a lot of formulas and coded in VBA to make Fullscreen modes and create a dashboard that felt like an app to capture all the data my team was getting from a deployment to Saudi Arabia.  We oversaw all the water on base, and this helped us win the Team of the Month award and many praises from leaders. Enjoy!
  * **Tools:**  R, Geostatistical Concepts

### Website - My Portfolio

  * **Repository:**  https://github.com/luigimagdamit/landing-page
  * **Description:**  I created a portfolio website https://silcott.github.io/, which is free to use a one-page site on GitHub to share along my journey and get the experience in creating a  website.  I used HTML, CSS, and jQuery/JavaScript.  I included a form at the bottom that I used https://formspree.io/ to create a responsive form.   Overall, I already knew a lot about web development, but it is always fun to build something like this.  Enjoy!
  * **Tools:**  HTML, CSS

  * **Repository:**  https://github.com/Silcott/PORTFOLIO-OF-PROJECTS/tree/master/PROJECTS/Turtle/birthday.py
  * **Description:**  This is something I did when I first started learning python.  It uses the Turtle tool that python has for young developers.  I programmed the turtle to move around and draw a message, which in this case is telling myself Happy Birthday.  Not a bad program.  It was hard to figure out how to turn the turtle and create the heart shapes were a real challenge.  Enjoy!
  * **Tools:**  React.js, Javascript, HTML, CSS
